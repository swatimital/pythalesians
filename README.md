# PyThalesians

PyThalesians is a Python financial library developed by the Thalesians (http://www.thalesians.com). I have used the library to develop my own trading strategies and I've included simple samples which show some of the functionality including an FX trend following model and other bits of financial analysis.

There are many open source Python libraries for making trading strategies around! However, I've developed this one to be as flexible as possible in terms of what types of strategies you can develop with it. In addition, a lot of the library can be used to analyse and plot financial data for broader based analysis, of the type that I've had to face being in markets over the years. Hence, it can be used by a wider array of users.

At present the PyThalesians offers:
* Backtesting of systematic trading strategies for cash markets (including cross sectional style trading strategies)
* Sensitivity analysis for systematic trading strategies parameters
* Seamless historic data downloading from Bloomberg (requires licence), Yahoo, Quandl, Dukascopy and other market data sources
* Produces beautiful line plots with Chartesians wrapper (via Matplotlib), Plotly (via cufflinks) and a simple wrapper for Bokeh
* Planning to spin out Chartesians into a different library
* Analyse seasonality analysis of markets
* Calculates some technical indicators and gives trading signals based on these
* Helper functions built on top of Pandas
* Automatic tweeting of charts
* And much more!
* Please bear in mind at present PyThalesians is currently a highly experimental alpha project and isn't yet fully 
documented
* Uses Apache 2.0 licence

# Chartesians

The Chartesians graphics engine, provides easy to use wrappers for doing simple plots with multiple backend chart libraries
such as Matplotlib, Plotly (via cufflinks) and Bokeh, without having to learn all the different APIs. We are planning to
spinout Chartesians into a separate project over time. The PyThalesians project uses the graphics capabilities
of Chartesians extensively.

# Requirements

PyThalesians has been tested on Windows 8 & 10, running Bloomberg Terminal software. 
I currently run PyThalesians using Anaconda 2.5 (Python 3.5 64bit) on Windows 10. Potentially, it could also work on the 
Bloomberg Server API (but I have not explicitly tested this). I have also tried running it on Ubuntu and Mac OS X (excluding Bloomberg API). If you
do not have a subscription to Bloomberg, PyThalesians can still access free data sources including Quandl.

Major requirements
* Required: Python 3.4, 3.5
* Required: pandas, matplotlib, numpy etc.
* Recommended: Bloomberg Python Open API
    * To use Bloomberg you will need to have a licence
    * Use experimental Python 3.4 version from Bloomberg http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/libraries/
    * Also download C++ version of Bloomberg API and extract into any location
        * eg. C:\blp\blpapi_cpp_3.9.10.1
    * For Python 3.5 - need to compile blpapi source using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 yourself
        * Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (Community Edition is free)
        * Before doing do be sure to add environment variables for the Bloomberg DLL (blpapi3_64.dll) to PATH variable
            * eg. C:\blp\blpapi_cpp_3.9.10.1\bin
        * Make sure BLPAPI_ROOT root is set as an environmental variable in Windows
            * eg. C:\blp\blpapi_cpp_3.9.10.1
        * python setup.py build
        * python setup.py install
    * For Python 3.4 - prebuilt executable can be run, which means we can skip the build steps above
        * Might need to tweak registry to avoid "Python 3.4 not found in registry error" (blppython.reg example) when using this executable 
    * Alternatively to access Bloomberg, the software also supports the old COM API (but I'm going to remove it because very slow)
* Recommended: Plotly for funky interactive plots (https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) and 
* Recommended: Cufflinks a nice Plotly
wrapper when using Pandas dataframes (Jorge Santos project now supports Python 3 
https://github.com/jorgesantos/cufflinks - so I recommend using that rather than my fork)
* Recommended: PyFolio for statistical analysis of trading strategy returns (https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio/)
* Recommended: multiprocessor_on_dill because standard multiprocessing library pickle causes issues 
(from https://github.com/sixty-north/multiprocessing_on_dill)

# Installation

Once installed please make sure you edit pythalesians.util.constants file for the following variables:
* PyThalesians should autodetect its own path, but if not, manually change root_pythalesians_folder variable - this will ensure that the logging (and a number of other features works correctly). 
Failure to do so will result in the project not starting
* Change the default Bloomberg settings (Which API to use? What server address to use?)
* Write in API keys for Quandl, Twitter, Plotly etc.
* Latest version can be installed using setup.py or pip (see below)

```
pip install git+https://github.com/thalesians/pythalesians.git
```

# Examples for PyThalesians

After installation, the easiest way to get started is by looking at the example scripts. I am hoping to add some Jupyter notebooks, illustrating how to use the library too. The example scripts show how to:

* Download market data from many different sources, Bloomberg, Yahoo, Quandl, Dukascopy etc
* Plot line charts, with different styles

# About the Thalesians

The Thalesians are a think tank of dedicated professionals with an interest in quantitative finance, economics, 
mathematics, physics and computer science, not necessarily in that order. We run quant finance events in London, New York,
Budapest, Prague and Frankfurt (join our Meetup.com group at http://events.thalesians.com). We also publish research
on systematic trading and also consult in the area. One of our clients is RavenPack, a major news analytics vendor.

# Major contributors to PyThalesians

* Saeed Amen - Saeed is the founder of Cuemacro (http://www.cuemacro.com), which deciphers how traders can use both existing and novel data sources
to better understand macro markets. He is also managing director and co-founder of the Thalesians. 
He has a decade of experience creating and successfully running systematic trading models at Lehman Brothers and Nomura. 
Independently, he runs a systematic trading model with proprietary capital. He is the author of Trading Thalesians – What the ancient world can teach us about trading today (Palgrave Macmillan). 
He graduated with a first class honours master’s degree from Imperial College in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

# Supporting PyThalesians project

If you find PyThalesians useful (and in particular if you are commercial company) please consider supporting the project
through sponsorship or by using Saeed's consultancy/research services in systematic trading. If you would like to contribute to the project, also let me know: it's a big task to try to build up this library on my own!

# Future Plans for PyThalesians

We plan to add the following features:
* Spin out Chartesians into different project
* Have a proper setup mechanism (eg. via pip), at present needs (partial) manual deployment
* Add Plotly & Seaborn wrappers for plotting (partially there)
* Improve support for Bokeh plotting (partially)
* Add more plots from Matlibplot
* Add Reuters as a historic data source
* Add ability to stream data from Bloomberg and Reuters
* Use event driven code to generate trading signals (to be used live and historically)
* Add more interesting trading analysis tools
* Add support for live trading via Interactive Brokers
* Integrate support for zipline as an alternative trading system
* Improve support for PyFolio
* Support Python 2.7+

More generally, we want to:
* Make existing code more robust
* Increase documentation and examples
